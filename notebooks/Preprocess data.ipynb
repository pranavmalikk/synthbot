This file contains a list of words that could not be processed because they don't exist in the pronunciation dictionary. You can find the current pronunciation dictionary in `/opt/mfa/pronunciations_dicts/english.dict.txt`. If you end up adding the pronunciations of any missing words, make sure to post them to the thread. I can update the Docker image so everyone can benefit from it."
